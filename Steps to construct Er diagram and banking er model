// The steps which we have to follow to construct an er diagram are:
1. Requirement engineering (ask what are the requirements of that particular database / what all is needed to be stored inside that db etc)
2. identify entity sets and type(strong / weak)
3. identify attributes and types(simple / composite / single valued / multivalued / derived)
4. identify relationship and constraints(mapping cardinality (1:1 , 1:N, N:1, N:N), participation constraint (total , partial) ,degree of realtionship (unary/binary/ternary))

// with all these we can easily create an er diagram. 


// ER diagram of banking system

1. Requirements: 
 - bank - branches
 - bank - customers
 - bank - employees
 - customer - account
 - customer - loan
 - customer - banker
 - account - saving account and current account
 - loan - payment scheduled     

2. Entity sets
 - branch 
 - customer 
 - employee
 - saving account        --|_ generated entity account
 - current account       --|
 - loan 
 - payment (loan - weak entity) 


3. Attributes
 - branch - name,city,assets,liabilities
 - customer - customerId,name,address,contactNo(multivalued),DateofBirth,Age(derived)
 - employee - employeeId(derived),name,contactNo,dependentName(multivalued),yearsOfService,startDate
 - saving account - accNo,balance,interestRate,dailyWithdrawlLimit
 - current account - accNo,balance,perTransactionCharge,overdraft amount
 -   Generated Entity - Account - accNo,balance
 - loan - loan number , amount 
 - payment(weak entity) - payment no , date,amount

4. Relationships 
 - customer borrows loans (M:N)
 - loan organized by branch (N:1)
 - loan loan payment payments (1:N)
 - customer deposits account (M:N)
 - customer banker employee (N:1)
 - employee manage by employee (N:1)
