// For more complex and optimized model we use some extended features 
1. specialisation : 
 it is when we split an entity set into subgroups based on their functionalities and features. 
 ( eg (person) is a (customer),(employee)). here person is broken into customer and employee. 

* the main entity is called superclass and the subgroup is called subclass. 
// it is a top down approach and is represented by a triangle component. relation word : (is-a)
// used to refine entities in db and show distinctive features of sub groups

2. Generalisation
_ it is reverse of specialisation , when two entities have many common attributes we create a new super class which is a generalised entity set. 
// it is bottom up approach and also represented by a triangle 
// makes db refined and common attributes are not repeated. 

3. Attribute inheritance - attributes of a higher class entity are inherited by a lower class entity.   (followed in both specialisation and generaisation)

4. Participation inheritance -  if parent entity participates than child also participates .

5. Aggregation :  it is used when we have to show relationship among relationship. 
  in this method we aggregate a relationship and consider it as a seperate entity set.(done by abstraction) 
  -then we make a relationship with this new aggregated entity set. 
  _ this reduces redundancy as instead of connecting every entity in a relationship to another entity via a relationship we connect a whole entity set to a new entity. 
    eg.          student ----school ----course
                  |            |         |               --> this creates redundancy 
                  |________guardian______|         

                [student----school----course]---guardian    -->this doesnt create redundancy
