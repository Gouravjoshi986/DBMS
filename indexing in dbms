Indexing is used to optimize the performance of database in minimizing number of disk access required when query is processed
    // Index is a data structure which is used to locate and access value in database quickly. 
    speed up operation is used in select and where clause.
    . It contains two parts: Search Key and Reference value
- search key - contains a copy of key of table (can be Pk or non primary key in sorted order). 
- reference value - contains reference/address to the location of base block where data of corresponding key is stored. 
/ Indexing is optional but it increases data access speed. but it is not primary means of accessing data,it is secondary mean. 
- index file is always sorted. -> to facilitate binary search in the ds. 

// Primary Index (clustering index) - > if the data file containing all data has its search key also in a sequential order then it is called a primary index. (primary index is a index whose search key also defines the sequential order of file). 

// all files are ordered on some search key / pk or non pk 
1. Dense index - contains a record for every search key value pair in data file. 
    It points to the actual record on the disk and needs more space. 
2. Sparse index - when only some search key value pair values are stored in index. 
it needs less space as it only stores the base block address value pair and when needed we do some processing to fetch items. 

// Based on key attribute - > PK used as search key / sorted based on PK / sparse index foramtion
// based on non key attribute - > sorted based on nonPk attr. / dense index as every unique non key attr is used / 
// Multi level index - when indexing is done in two or more levels (when binary search of one levels takes too much time)

// Secondary index (non clustering index) - unsorted / every tuple is used to create and store search value pair / dense indexing/

adv = faster access , less io
